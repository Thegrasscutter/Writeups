# Introduction
There is no CTF without splunk. This is a challenge where we are purely supposed to dig down in the splunk universe and explore accordingly. I am no splunk wiz, but luckily the challenge isn't that hard.
The description of the challenge is: *Help Angel Candysalt solve the Splunk challenge in Santa's great hall. Fitzy Shortstack is in Santa's lobby, and he knows a few things about Splunk. What does Santa call you when when you complete the analysis?*

Here we have 8 tasks, that are all unlocked one after the other.
