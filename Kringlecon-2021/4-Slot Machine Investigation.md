# Introduction
This challenge is all about exploiting Jacks slotsystem. Everything can be done in browser and I really reccommend using firefox, simply becuase the interface is less confusing.
The description for this challenge is:
*Test the security of Jack Frost's slot machines. What does the Jack Frost Tower casino security team threaten to do when your coin total exceeds 1000? Submit the string in the server data.response element. Talk to Noel Boetie outside Santa's Castle for help.*
