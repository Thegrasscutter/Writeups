# Introduction
## The challenge
The challenge is to undergo open source intelligence to pinpoint where and who the travelling elf is. The clue here is to read everything closely and try to relate every hint to something to identify the elf with. The answer for the challenge will most likely vary from user to user, so you will have to probably find your own solution based on the same steps I took.

## The system
There are three functions within this challenge. They are Investigate, Visit InterRink and Depart by sleigh.
The Investigate system would allow you to investigate the current surroundings and obtain hints to the next location or about the travelling elf. There are always three things to investigate.
The Visit InterRink will allow you to plot in facts about the elf and it will narrow down the possible matches for you.
The Depart by sleigh function will take you to the next destination, so you can harvest more hints and progress in the challenge.

# The journey
We start off by gathering facts at our starting location. This may vary but the method of solving this challenge is the same.
## Santas Castle
The staring location Santas Castle provitdes these hints:
  - They said, if asked, they would describe their next location in three words as "frozen, push, and tamed." 
  - They were checking the Ofcom frequency table to see what amateur frequencies they could use while there.
  - They were dressed for 10.0째C and overcast conditions. The elf mentioned something about Stack Overflow and Golang.
  
The first hint refers to our next location, "frozen, push and tamed".
The second hint also refers to the next location, a quick google search tells us that Ofcom stands for Office of Communication and is based in England. ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ofcom )
The last hint confirms where to go by telling us the temperature in the region. England does sound like 10.0C and overcast. But more importantly it tells us that the elf uses Stack Overflow and Golang.

The locations we can choose are London-England, Stuttgart-Germany or Prague-Czech Republic. The answer is obviously London.

## London, England
This location provides the following hints
  - They said something about MGRS and 32U NU 05939 98268... 
  - Apparently they really wanted to see what a town hall looks like when it's converted into a giant Advent calendar! 
  - They were dressed for 5.0째C and overcast conditions. The elf got really heated about using spaces for indents. 

The first hint is a MGRS coordinate system. This translates to Baden-W체rttemberg in Stuttgart. So it is clear that we are going to Germany.( https://legallandconverter.com/p50.html )
The second hint confirms our suspicion of where we are going. A quick google search tells us that a town in Gengenbach, Germany decorates their town hall as a giant advent calendar.
The last hint doesn't help too much about where we are going but tells us that the elf uses spaces for indents.

The locations we can choose are London-England, Copenhagen-Denmark, or Stuttgart-Germany.

## Stuttgart, Germany
This locations provides the following hints
  - Their next waypoint was something like 51.219, 4.402
  - They just contacted us from an address in the 81.244.0.0/14 range.
  - They were dressed for 9.0째C and partly cloudy conditions. They kept checking their Snapchat app. 

The first hint is a lat long gridsystem. This translates to Groenplaats, 2000 Antwerpen, Belgium according to google maps.
The second hint discusses an IP address, this address belongs to Belgium according to open sources. ( https://whois.domaintools.com/81.244.0.0 )
The last hint doesn't narrow down the location, but the important part here is the snapchat app information.

Now we have enough hints to narrow down the possibilities. By plotting in the language spoken (GOLANG), preferred social media (SNAPCHAT), preferred indents (spaces), we get a result of Jingle Ringford!

# The reveal
Upon arriving our final destination (Belgium as we found previously) we see that we can no longe travel. The options we have left is investigate or visit the InterRink. We allready know who it is, so by choosing investigate we catch the elf and need to reveal his name! Jingle Ringford it is, and thus we win the game!
