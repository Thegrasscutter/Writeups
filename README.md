# Good morning all!
This project is a joint cooperation between Jezpoz and Thegrasscutter. We want to provide help and share knowledge where ever we can, simutainiously open your third eye to the world of information security. So we hope that you will find this useful and reach out to us with any questions or requests. 
The writeups on this page will be created by TGC while Jezpoz will maintain the website. This isn't for profit, simply to get better at what we do.

# Whoami
## Thegrasscutter
TGC is a junior penetration tester that spends his days either behind screens or on mountains. I am currently working on a OSCP certification and hope to take part in the information security world. As of now, I have no specific area of expertise, but it's better to be a jack of all trades than a master of one. Hope to hear from you and please do come with requests! Please update your computer and secure your data before someone else does it for you!

## Jezpoz
Jezpoz is a senior frontend developer that prioritizes getting the job done before getting paid. Once he sets his mind to something only the lack of coffee could stop him. He is currently working at Oslo Digital, maintaining every aspect of their digital existance.
